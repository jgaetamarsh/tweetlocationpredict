Codecademy Supervised Learning Project Tweet Location/

This was one of the final projects for the Data Science Path's Supervised Learning section. There was some insruction given, but I did not use the answer key or any outside help to complete. This notebook demonstrates how to use a Naive Bayes classifier to determine the location of a tween by the text of the tweet. It ends with a Tweet I created and it properly classified.
